Working on an Arduino Project for Professor Grisetti's Sistemi Operativi course at Sapienza University of Rome.

Without using the Arduino IDE (so using bare metal programming) we are going to implement a system to read one or more sensors, like digital pins, and to deliver
binary messages to the PC, following a binary protocol (and not text). On the PC, we're going to implement a program to interact with the Arduino to display
the incoming messages.
