Without using the Arduino IDE nor using bare metal programming, we are going to implement a system to read one or more sensors, like digital pins, and to deliver
binary messages to the PC, following a binary protocol. On the PC, we're going to implement a program to interact with the Arduino to display
the incoming messages.
